# My GPT — Built from Scratch

> Assembled from the NeetCode ML course on [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io)
> Built by **Ziyad El Fettahi** on August 27, 2026

Every file in this project is code I wrote and submitted while completing the NeetCode ML course.
The problems progressively build from gradient descent fundamentals all the way to a working GPT.
